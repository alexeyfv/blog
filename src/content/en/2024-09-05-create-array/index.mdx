How do you create an array in C#? It seems like a simple question. But with each new version of .NET, new features appear. Right now, I know 7 different ways to create arrays.

## new T[]

The most obvious, simple, and popular way to create arrays (and objects in general). This operator is used everywhere and is the default option in most scenarios.

## stackalloc T[]

Allocates memory on the stack for an array of a fixed size and returns a pointer. In the past, `stackalloc` required an `unsafe` context, but with `Span<T>`, it can now be used safely. This method is limited by the stack’s memory size and may cause a `StackOverflowException` if used carelessly.

For small arrays, `stackalloc T[]` is on average 20% faster than `new T[]`, and up to 88% faster for large arrays. "Small arrays" means arrays smaller than 85,000 bytes (allocated on the Small Object Heap — SOH), "Large arrays" are allocated on the Large Object Heap (LOH).

## ArrayPool\<T\>

`ArrayPool<T>` returns an array from a shared pool, reducing memory allocations and GC pressure. The returned array may be larger than requested — e.g., a request for 700 elements might return an array of length 1024. This is useful for relatively large temporary arrays that are frequently created and discarded.

`ArrayPool<T>` is on average 30% faster than `new T[]` for small arrays and 89% faster for large ones.  
However, for arrays smaller than 300–400 bytes, using the pool can be slower.

## GC.AllocateUninitializedArray\<T\>

This method creates an array without initializing elements to their default values. It can be unsafe since the array contains uninitialized memory. You must overwrite all values before using them.

`GC.AllocateUninitializedArray<T>` is about 15% faster than `new T[]` for arrays between 2,048 and 85,000 bytes.  
In other cases, performance is similar to `new T[]`.

## Array.CreateInstance

Allows you to create arrays with types known only at runtime. Useful when dealing with dynamically typed code.

Performance is either the same or slightly worse than `new T[]`.

## InlineArrayAttribute

A relatively new feature introduced in C# 12. It allows you to define a struct with the `InlineArray` attribute that behaves like a fixed-size array.

On average, it’s 39% faster than `new T[]` for small arrays and 91% faster for large arrays.

## Collection Expressions

Syntactic sugar that lets you define arrays using literals.  
For example, `int[] array = [1, 2, 3]` creates a heap-allocated array (like `new T[]`),  
while `Span<int> array = [1, 2, 3]` creates a stack-allocated array (like `stackalloc`).
