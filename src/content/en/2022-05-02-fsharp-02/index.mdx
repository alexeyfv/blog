In the [previous article](2022-05-01-fsharp-01), we created a module to calculate Fibonacci numbers, but we didn’t really explore what F# is or how it's different from C#. In this post, we'll look at the basics of functional programming, some core F# language features, and what the compiled code looks like.

## Simple Values

Let’s start with the simplest thing — defining [basic values](https://github.com/alexeyfv/FSharpOverview).

```fsharp
let hello = "Hello, world!"
let mutable year = 2022
```

Here, `hello` is a read-only static property — a function that returns the same value every time. This is F#’s default behavior and how it ensures immutability. If we want to allow changes, we must use the `mutable` keyword. Then the value becomes a property with both getter and setter.

```csharp
public static string hello => "Hello, world!";
public static int year { get; set; }
```

> C# code equivalent to F# is often longer because of how decompilers work. I’ve simplified the output here. For full detail, you can use tools like [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/ru-ru/decompiler/) or [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/).

## Function Values

Now let’s turn `hello` into a function that takes an argument and returns a greeting. We'll do this in five different ways:

```fsharp
let hello1 x = $"Hello " + x + "!"
let hello2 x = $"Hello {x}!"
let hello3 (x: string) = $"Hello {x}!" // explicit input type
let hello4 (x: int) = $"Hello {x}!" // another input type
let hello5 x : string = $"Hello {x}!" // explicit output type
```

All these functions are declared using `let`, just like values. That’s one key idea in functional languages — functions are [first-class values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function). They can be passed around like any other value.

Here's what some of them look like after compilation:

```csharp
public static string hello1(string x) => string.Concat("Hello ", x, "!");

// hello2 and hello5 are the same
public static string hello2<a>(a x)
{
    object[] array = new object[1];
    array[0] = x;
    return PrintfModule.PrintFormatToStringThen(
        new PrintfFormat<string, Unit, string, string, a>(
            "Hello %P()!", array, null));
}
```

Notes:

- `hello2` becomes a generic method because the type wasn’t explicitly given.
- `hello3` and `hello4` are not generic because their input types are defined.
- String interpolation in F# compiles to more complex C# code than a simple `string.Format`.

Compare this with a basic C# function:

```csharp
public string hello3(int x) => string.Format("Hello, {0}!", x);
```

## Types and Currying

Here are two functions that do the same thing:

```fsharp
let sum1 x y = x + y
let sum2 x = fun y -> x + y
```

In C#:

```csharp
// sum1(1, 2) => 3
public int sum1(int x, int y) => x + y;

// sum2(1)(2) => 3
public Func<int, int> sum2(int x) => (y) => x + y;
```

In F#, these two versions are equivalent. In functional programming, functions that take multiple arguments are transformed into a series of single-argument functions — this is called [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying).

This means that:

```fsharp
type operation = int -> int -> int
```

…defines a function that takes an `int`, returns another function that also takes an `int`, and finally returns an `int`.

## Functions as Parameters

As mentioned earlier, functions in F# can be passed around like values. For example:

```fsharp
let operationAsInput (op: operation) x y = op x y
let operationAsOutput : operation = fun x -> fun y -> x * y

let result = operationAsInput operationAsOutput 10 5 // result = 50
```

What’s happening:

1. `operationAsInput` takes a function and two values, then calls that function.
2. `operationAsOutput` returns a function that multiplies two numbers.
3. We call `operationAsInput` with `operationAsOutput` and the values 10 and 5.

This technique allows for dependency injection, function composition, and many design patterns.

Here's how this looks after decompilation to C#:

```csharp
public static int operationAsInput(
    FSharpFunc<int, FSharpFunc<int, int>> op, int x, int y) =>
    FSharpFunc<int, int>.InvokeFast(op, x, y);

public static int operationAsOutput(int x, int y) => x * y;
```

## Operators as Functions

In .NET, operators are just methods. The `+` operator for `int` becomes something like:

```csharp
.method public static int32 op_Addition (int32 a, int32 b)
```

In functional style, this operator is a function: `int -> int -> int`. So all of these are equivalent:

```fsharp
let sumInfix x y = x + y
let sumPrefix x y = (+) x y

let incrementInfix x = x + 1
let incrementPrefix = (+) 1
```

C# decompilation shows that most of these compile normally:

```csharp
public static int sumInfix(int x, int y) => x + y;
public static int incrementInfix(int x) => x + 1;
```

But `incrementPrefix` is more complex — it becomes a static field holding a function instance:

```csharp
public static class Functions
{
    internal sealed class incrementPrefix@8 : FSharpFunc<int, int>
    {
        internal static readonly incrementPrefix@8 @_instance = new incrementPrefix@8();
        public override int Invoke(int y) => 1 + y;
    }

    public static FSharpFunc<int, int> incrementPrefix => $_.incrementPrefix@8;
}

internal static class $_
{
    internal static readonly FSharpFunc<int, int> incrementPrefix@8;
    static $_()
    {
        incrementPrefix@8 = Functions.incrementPrefix@8.@_instance;
    }
}
```

## Summary

In this article, we explored key principles of functional programming:

- Functions are first-class values — they can be used as arguments or return values.
- This enables clean composition and design flexibility.
- In functional languages, types describe input/output behavior of functions, not just classes or structs.
