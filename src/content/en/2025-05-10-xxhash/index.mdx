Recently at work, I needed to compute a stable hash for some objects. At first, I thought about using standard cryptographic algorithms like SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, or MD5. But they have two problems:

1. The hash is too large — from 160 to 512 bits.
2. They return a byte array, which causes extra memory allocations.

So I started looking for an alternative. I quickly found the [xxHash repository](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) and its [C# implementation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.hashing.xxhash3). The key advantages of xxHash are high speed and the ability to return the hash as an integer.

It's important to understand that xxHash is **not** a cryptographic algorithm. It's made for other use cases: fast hashing, comparing data, cache keys, or database indexes.

## xxHash in .NET

To use xxHash in your app, you need to install the [System.IO.Hashing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.IO.Hashing) package. It includes four versions of the xxHash algorithm:

| Algorithm | Hash size |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| XxHash32  | 32 bits   |
| XxHash64  | 64 bits   |
| XxHash3   | 64 bits   |
| XxHash128 | 128 bits  |

## Performance

I [compared](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/tree/main/Hashing) these algorithms by how fast they compute a hash. I also added SHA1, SHA2, SHA3, and MD5 to the test. The results:

[Here are the full results](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/blob/a73512251ebd4e1c2d7af364b268d92c9d7136ee/Hashing/Results/Benchmark.HashAlgorithms-report-github.md). As expected, xxHash is one of the fastest.

## Example usage

xxHash is easy to use and has useful features:

– **`Append` method** — lets you add data step by step, without extra allocations.  
– **Integer output** — the result can be `uint`, `ulong`, or `UInt128`, instead of a byte array.  
– **Supports `Span<T>`** — so you can work with stack memory and avoid heap allocations.

Here’s an example of how to use it:

```csharp
public class SomeObject
{
    [ThreadStatic]
    private static readonly XxHash3 hasher;

    static SomeObject() => hasher = new();

    public required int IntValue { get; init; }
    public required string StringValue { get; init; }
    public required DateTimeOffset DateTimeValue { get; init; }

    public ulong GetStableHashCode()
    {
        hasher.Reset();

        var idBytes = MemoryMarshal.Cast<int, byte>([IntValue]);
        hasher.Append(idBytes);

        var bytesCount = Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount(StringValue);
        Span<byte> stringBytes = stackalloc byte[bytesCount];
        Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(StringValue, stringBytes);
        hasher.Append(stringBytes);

        var unixTime = DateTimeValue.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds();
        var dateBytes = MemoryMarshal.Cast<long, byte>([unixTime]);
        hasher.Append(dateBytes);

        return hasher.GetCurrentHashAsUInt64();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Using xxHash to compute stable hashes gives you many benefits:

– **High performance.** One of the fastest algorithms available.  
– **No heap allocations.** With `Span` and `Append`, you can hash using only the stack and CPU registers.  
– **Small and simple values.** You get `uint` or `ulong` results (only 4 or 8 bytes). These work great with database indexes and allow simpler queries. Instead of `WHERE col1 = ... AND col2 = ...`, you can write `WHERE Hash = ...`. This is especially useful when your table has hundreds of millions of rows.
