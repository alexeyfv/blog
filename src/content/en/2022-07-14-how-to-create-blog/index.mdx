*Note: This is an outdated post. My blog is currently running on Astro.*

Many developers run their own blogs to share notes and thoughts. These blogs are often built using Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby.js, and hosted with GitHub or GitLab. In this guide, I'll show how I set up my own blog using Jekyll and GitHub.

## Why GitHub

There are many reasons to use GitHub:

- **GitHub Pages** lets you host static sites for free.
- It has built-in support for **Jekyll**.
- You can update posts using `git commit` and `git push`.
- Posts are stored in a remote repository.
- **GitHub Actions** can build and deploy your blog automatically.

That said, you could also use **GitLab**, which offers similar features.

## Requirements

To build your blog, you’ll need:

- **Ruby** – for building and running the blog locally
- **Jekyll** – for blog configuration
- **Markdown** – for writing posts
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** – for editing layouts and adding scripts
- **Git** – to track changes
- **GitHub** – to store your repository
- **GitHub Actions** – to build and deploy
- **GitHub Pages** – to host your blog

Don't worry — you don’t need to be an expert in all of these. For example, **Ruby** is only needed if you want to preview the blog locally. You can even skip Ruby and Jekyll if you’re okay with pushing changes and waiting for the site to deploy each time.

## Ruby and Jekyll

### Installing Ruby

**Jekyll** is a static site generator. You write posts in Markdown, and Jekyll turns them into static HTML pages. Since Jekyll is written in Ruby, install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) first. On Windows, the setup is simple — just click "Next" a few times.

### Installing Jekyll

Once Ruby is installed, use Ruby's package manager to install Jekyll:

```console
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Creating a project

To create a blog project from a template:

```console
jekyll new myblog
```

This will create a folder called `myblog`:

<Image src={image01} alt="project folder screenshot" />

### Project structure

Let’s look at the important files.

#### \_config.yml

This is the main config file for Jekyll. The official [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/) is brief, so here’s an [example config](https://github.com/alexeyfv/blog/blob/master/_config.yml) from my blog:

```yml
title: alexeyfv.blog
description: Articles about .NET, C# and much more
baseurl: ''
url: 'http://www.alexeyfv.xyz/'
theme: minima

author:
  name: © 2022 Alexey Fedorov

minima:
  skin: dark
  social_links:
    github: alexeyfv
    linkedin: alexeyfv
    telegram: alexeyfv

header_pages:
  - _pages/tags.html
  - _pages/projects.md
  - _pages/about.

include: ['_pages']
show_excerpts: true
```

#### Gemfile and Gemfile.lock

These files manage dependencies with Ruby’s Bundler. You usually don’t need to edit them.

#### index.markdown, about.markdown, 404.html

These are sample blog pages. You can customize them or move them into a separate `_pages` folder. Jekyll supports both HTML and Markdown for page content. For layout customization, check the [minima theme repo](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

#### \_posts folder

This is where your blog posts go. All posts in this folder will show on the homepage.

### Running the blog locally

To preview the blog:

```console
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you see the error `cannot load such file -- webrick`, add this line to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/`.

## Blog Setup

Now you can start writing posts. The official [Jekyll guide on posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) is good, so I’ll just share a few extra tips here.

### Tags

Jekyll doesn’t support tags out of the box, so you need to add it manually. Here’s the functionality I wanted:

- Show tags in each post
- View a list of tags
- Show post count per tag
- Filter posts by tag

My implementation is based on two articles ([this one](https://blog.lunarlogic.io/2019/managing-tags-in-jekyll-blog-easily) and [this one](https://vilcins.medium.com/tags-in-jekyll-3e1786ffc040)) with a few changes.

#### Show tags in a post

Copy `_layouts/post.html` from the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/master/_layouts/post.html) into your project, then add this inside the `<header>`:

```html
{% raw %}{% for tag in page.tags %}
<a class="post" href="{{site.baseurl}}/tag/{{tag}}">#{{tag}}</a>
{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```

#### View all tags and count

Create a `_pages/tags.html` file like this:

```html
{% raw %}--- permalink: /tags/ layout: page title: Tags ---

<ul>
  {% assign tags = site.posts | all_tags %} {% for tag in tags %}
  <li>
    <a class="tag-link" href="{{site.baseurl}}/tag/{{tag['name']}}">
      #{{ tag['name'] }} ({{ tag['count'] }})
    </a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
```

Then add a plugin to `_plugins` that counts tags:

```ruby
module Jekyll
  module TagsCounter
    def all_tags(posts)
      counts = {}

      posts.each do |post|
        post['tags'].each do |tag|
          counts[tag] ||= 0
          counts[tag] += 1
        end
      end

      counts.keys.reject(&:empty?).map do |tag|
        { 'name' => tag, 'count' => counts[tag] }
      end.sort_by { |t| -t['count'] }
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_filter(Jekyll::TagsCounter)
```

#### Filter posts by tag

Create `_layouts/tag.html` like this:

```html
{% raw %}--- layout: default ---

<h1>#{{page.tag}}</h1>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %} {% if post.tags contains page.tag %}
  <li><a class="post" href="{{post.url}}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endif %} {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
```

Then add a plugin in `_plugins` that generates tag pages:

```ruby
module Jekyll
  class TagPageGenerator < Generator
    safe true

    def generate(site)
      tags = site.posts.docs.flat_map { |post| post.data['tags'] || [] }.to_set
      tags.each do |tag|
        site.pages << TagPage.new(site, site.source, tag)
      end
    end
  end

  class TagPage < Page
    def initialize(site, base, tag)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir  = File.join('tag', tag)
      @name = 'index.html'

      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'tag.html')
      self.data['tag'] = tag
      self.data['title'] = "Tag: #{tag}"
    end
  end
end
```

This plugin will create folders like `site/tag/javascript/index.html` for every tag.

### Comments

Jekyll doesn’t include a comment system. There are many options ([this guide](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/165528/how-to-add-comments-in-blog-posts-on-github-pages-websites) lists a few). I use [utterances](https://utteranc.es/), which is based on GitHub Issues. It’s simple to set up — just follow the steps on their site and paste the generated JS snippet at the end of `_layouts/post.html`.

## Building and Deploying via GitHub

Once your blog is ready, you can publish it. I use **GitHub Pages** since it supports Jekyll natively and hosts my repo.

However, GitHub Pages has restrictions — you can’t use custom plugins directly. So you must build the blog yourself and then deploy it.

Here’s how to split it into two steps:

### 1. Build with GitHub Actions

Use [jekyll-deploy-action](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-deploy-action). Just add a YAML file to your repo. It will create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push to `master`, builds the site, and pushes it to `gh-pages`.

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

In your repo’s **Settings**, go to **Pages** and select the `gh-pages` branch.

<Image src={image02} alt="GitHub Pages Settings Screenshot" />

Your blog will be published at `https://<username>.github.io/<projectname>/`. You can also set a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) if you buy one from a domain provider.
