This is a new part of a series where I analyze [.NET code quality rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/) from a performance perspective. Today, let's talk about [CA1830: Prefer strongly-typed Append and Insert method overloads on StringBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1830).

## Rule description

This rule suggest us not to convert parameters to string when using `Append` or `Insert` methods:

```cs
var i = 123;  
var sb = new StringBuilder();  
sb.Append(i.ToString()); // CA1830
```

Instead, pass the value directly:

```cs
var i = 123;  
var sb = new StringBuilder();  
sb.Append(i);
```

This rule applies to well-known primitive types like `byte`, `short`, `int`, `double`, `long`, and so on.

## Performance analysis

I wrote a simple [benchmark](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/blob/main/CodeAnalysis/CA1830.cs) to see how much these approaches really affect performance. The results are [in the repo](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/blob/main/CodeAnalysis/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/Benchmark.Ca1830-report-github.md) and on the diagram below.

There's a small time difference between these two approaches — about 5 microseconds on my laptop. The memory difference is more significant — about 20 KiB.

## How the optimization works?

When you use a strongly-typed overload like Append(int), .NET internally calls methods like: [`AppendSpanFormattable<T>`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Text/StringBuilder.cs#L1056) and [`InsertSpanFormattable<T>`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Text/StringBuilder.cs#L1412).

Here’s a simplified version of `AppendSpanFormattable<T>`:

```cs
private StringBuilder AppendSpanFormattable<T>(T value) where T : ISpanFormattable  
{  
    if (value.TryFormat(RemainingCurrentChunk, out int charsWritten, format: default, provider: null))  
    {  
        m_ChunkLength += charsWritten;  
        return this;  
    }

    return Append(value.ToString());  
}
```

This method uses [`ISpanFormattable.TryFormat`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.ispanformattable.tryformat) to write the value directly into the internal buffer as a `Span<char>`. This avoids: allocating a temporary string, boxing value types, calling the virtual `ToString()` method.

## Should you care?

Yes, you probably should. Even if we don’t care about performance benefits, this code:

```cs
sb.Append(i);
```

…is cleaner and simpler than:

```cs
sb.Append(i.ToString());
```

And as a bonus — it's faster and allocates less memory. Win-win.
