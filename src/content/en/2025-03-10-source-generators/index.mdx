In November, I [wrote](https://t.me/yet_another_dev/152) about EventFlow library designed for DDD and Event Sourcing. Our team actively uses it. After working with it for several months, I noticed that I often had to write repetitive code, which became quite tedious.

For example:

To create an event for the OrderAggregate, you have to specify the aggregate type and its ID type each time.

``` cs
public class OrderCreated : 
    IAggregateEvent<OrderAggregate, OrderAggregateId>
```

When subscribing to events, you need to specify the event type, aggregate, and ID.

```cs
public class OrderAggregateSubscribers :
    ISubscribeSynchronousTo<OrderAggregate, OrderAggregateId, OrderCreated>
```

## How to avoid such boilerplate code?

You can declare an abstract class for all aggregate events and use it:

``` cs
public abstract class OrderAggregateEvent : 
    IAggregateEvent<OrderAggregate, OrderAggregateId>;
```

Create a new interface that accepts only the event type:

``` cs
public interface ISubscribeSynchronousTo<TEvent> : 
    ISubscribeSynchronousTo<OrderAggregate, OrderAggregateId, TEvent> 
```

But even in this case, you still have to manually duplicate code for each aggregate. And as the well-known IT wisdom says:

> Never spend 10 minutes doing something manually if you can spend 10 hours trying to automate it.

So, in early February, I started writing a code generator for EventFlow. After 2 weeks and 7 commits, the EventFlow.SourceGenerators library was ready, and recently, Rasmus Mikkelsen (the author of EventFlow) [accepted the changes](https://github.com/eventflow/EventFlow/releases/tag/v1.2.0).

## How do code generators help?

Now all the tedious work is handled by the compiler, allowing us to write less code that is also more readable.

``` cs
// Add the AggregateExtensions attribute to the aggregate
[AggregateExtensions]
public class OrderAggregate(OrderAggregateId id) :
    AggregateRoot<OrderAggregate, OrderAggregateId>(id)

// Declaring events - OrderAggregateEvent is generated automatically
public class OrderCreated : OrderAggregateEvent;

// Subscribing to events - The new interface is generated automatically
public class OrderAggregateSubscribers :
    ISubscribeSynchronousTo<OrderCreated>
```

As you can see, the code is noticeably cleaner, and we no longer have to repeatedly specify the aggregate type.

## Challenges in working with code generators

It's important to note that code generators are a complex topic with many restrictions and challenges. Here are some I encountered:

- Generators can only be written for .NET Standard 2.0.
- Name collisions in generated objects are possible.
- Testing generated code has its own peculiarities.

## What's Next?

If you're interested in code generators, I recommend starting with this [video from Microsoft](https://youtu.be/KTsyS3rDUgg).

Then, check out the following resources:

- [Creating an Incremental Generator](https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-source-generator-part-1-creating-an-incremental-source-generator/).
- [Introducing C# Source Generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/).
- [Incremental Generators Cookbook](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/incremental-generators.cookbook.md).

As an example, you can look at the source code of the EventFlow.SourceGenerators [library](https://github.com/eventflow/EventFlow/tree/develop-v1/Source/EventFlow.SourceGenerators) and its [tests](https://github.com/eventflow/EventFlow/tree/develop-v1/Source/EventFlow.SourceGenerators.Tests). It's quite simple. More usage examples can be found in the [documentation](https://geteventflow.net/additional/source-generation/).
