I recently came across AI-generated music on Yandex Music. I'm ok with the existence of AI-generated music, photos and videos. But as a user, I just want to know if the content was fully created with AI (so I can filter it out, hehe).

## What is AI slop?

AI slop is content generated by AI without human review in the process. For example, adding generated code to a repository without an engineer's review, or music produced entirely by a AI.

## Criteria for AI slop

Unfortunately, Yandex Music doesn't have any labeling for AI-artists. Maybe they haven't developed criteria yet? Or maybe it's simply beneficial for them to promote such music?

Either way, this situation made me think about vibe-coding, and I started thinking and developed criteria for determining if the project is AI-slop:

1. Can you recreate the project without AI?
2. If AI disappeared, can you maintain the project (implement new features, fix bugs, deliver updates)?
3. Do you understand and can explain the key decisions made during the project development?

## Example

If the answers are:

1. It would be slower, but yes.
2. Yes, of course.
3. Yes, because I made all the decisions.

Then you can say the project was made by a human or with AI as an assistant.

Otherwise — it's AI slop.
