This is part of a series where I analyze [.NET code quality rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/) from a performance perspective. Today, let's talk about [CA1826: Use property instead of Linq Enumerable method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1826).

## Rule description

This rule simply asks not to use `First()`, `Last()`, `Count()` methods from LINQ with `IReadOnlyList<T>`:

```cs
IReadOnlyList<string> list = ["str1", "str2", "str3"];
var first = list.First();   // CA1826
var last = list.Last();     // CA1826
var count = list.Count();   // CA1826
```

Instead, you should use indexer or `Count` property for better performance:

```cs
IReadOnlyList<string> list = ["str1", "str2", "str3"];
var first = list[0];
var last = list[^1];
var count = list.Count;
```

## Performance analysis

I wrote a simple [benchmark](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/blob/main/CodeAnalysis/CA1826.cs) to see how much LINQ methods really affect performance. The results are [in the repo](https://github.com/alexeyfv/DotNetBenchmarks/blob/main/CodeAnalysis/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/results/Benchmark.Ca1826-report-github.md) and on the diagram below.

As you can see, there's a difference between LINQ and direct access. But the difference is very small â€” just a few microseconds on my machine.

## Should you care?

In most cases, no. The performance gain is small. But if you're writing high-performance code, or these LINQ methods appear in a loop, it might be worth to refactor your code.
