Recently I read a book [^1] called [Unit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/unit-testing) by Vladimir Khorikov. It’s a great and solid book. I’d say it’s as useful for .NET backend developers as _CLR via C#_, _Dependency Injection in .NET_, or _Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture_.

Besides testing, the book briefly touches on functional architecture and how it makes code easier to test. I had never worked with functional programming before, but after reading it, I wanted to try. Since I’m a C# developer, the easiest way was to explore Microsoft’s own F# language. In this post, we’ll implement the same algorithm in both C# and F# in a functional style and compare them.

## Object-Oriented Programming

Let’s say we need to compute the first `n` Fibonacci numbers and print them to the console. Here's [one way to do that in C#](https://github.com/alexeyfv/FunctionalProgramming):

```csharp
public class FibonacciWriter
{
    public void Write(uint n)
    {
        uint prev = 0;
        uint next = 1;

        Console.WriteLine(prev);

        uint i = 1;

        while (i++ < n)
        {
            var next2 = prev + next;
            prev = next;
            next = next2;

            Console.WriteLine(prev);
        }
    }
}
```

What’s the problem with this approach? For example, if we want to change the output from the console to a file, we can't — this breaks the Open/Closed Principle. One solution is to introduce an abstract method `Output`:

```csharp
public abstract class FibonacciWriter
{
    public void Write(uint n)
    {
        uint prev = 0;
        uint next = 1;

        Output(prev);

        uint i = 1;

        while (i++ < n)
        {
            var next2 = prev + next;
            prev = next;
            next = next2;

            Output(prev);
        }
    }

    protected abstract void Output(uint i);
}

public class FibonacciConsoleWriter : FibonacciWriter
{
    protected override void Output(uint i) =>
        Console.Write($"{i} ");
}
```

This implementation is common and mostly fine, but it breaks the Single Responsibility Principle. It’s also hard to unit-test because `Write` returns nothing — we’d have to override `Output` to verify results. Clearly, we need to separate logic from output. Functional programming helps with that.

## Functional Programming

Functional programming is based on **pure functions**. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), a pure function:

1. Returns the same output for the same input
2. Has no side effects (like modifying state or writing to files)

So, is `Write` a pure function? Definitely not. It has side effects (writing to the console) and returns nothing.

Let’s rewrite the Fibonacci class in a functional style:

```csharp
public class Fibonacci
{
    public IEnumerable<uint> Get(uint n) => Next(0, 1).Take(10);

    private IEnumerable<uint> Next(uint previous, uint current)
    {
        yield return previous;

        foreach (var item in Next(current, previous + current))
        {
            yield return item;
        }
    }
}
```

### Key improvements:

- The `Get` method returns a collection (`IEnumerable<uint>`), which is easier to test.
- The data is immutable.
- There are no side effects.
- Logic and output are separate and can evolve independently.

So yes, we can write functional-style code in C#. But why use F#?

### A few reasons:

- In F#, data is immutable by default. You can't just change values like in OOP languages.
- F# syntax is designed for functional programming. It's clean and compact.

Here’s the same logic written in F#:

```fsharp
module Fibonacci =

    let next (previous, current) =
        Some(previous, (current, previous + current))

    let get n = Seq.unfold (next) (0, 1) |> Seq.take n
```

This version is much shorter. What's different:

- No curly braces. Blocks are separated by indentation (like Python).
- `Seq.unfold` is similar to `yield` in C#. It generates sequences.
- The `|>` operator (pipe) is used to chain function calls.
- You don’t have to write types — F# infers them.

## C# + F# Together

The beauty of .NET is that C# can use code written in F#. So you can write logic in F# and call it from your C# app:

```csharp
Console.Write("F# Fibonacci: ");
foreach (var item in FSharp.Fibonacci.get(10))
{
    Console.Write($"{item} ");
}
Console.WriteLine();
```

When compiled, the `Fibonacci` module from F# becomes a static class in C#:

```csharp
public static class Fibonacci
{
    public static FSharpOption<Tuple<int, Tuple<int, int>>> next(int previous, int current)
    {
        // next implementation
    }

    public static IEnumerable<int> get(int n)
    {
        // get implementation
    }
}
```

This lets you separate concerns: you can write business logic in F# and everything else (like services, data access) in C#.

## Summary

Functional programming helps build clean architecture that follows SOLID principles. It makes code easier to test and maintain. F# is great for this style of programming, and because it works well with C#, you don’t have to choose just one language.
