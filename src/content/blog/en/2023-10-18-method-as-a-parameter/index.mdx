There is an [article](https://habr.com/ru/companies/skbkontur/articles/721822/) on Habr about performance issues when passing a method as a parameter in C#. The author showed that passing an instance method as a parameter inside `for` loops may degrade performance and increase memory consumption due to unnecessary object allocations in the heap. In this short article, I want to repeat the original benchmark and compare how things have changed since the .NET 7 release.

## Benchmark

In the original article, the author compared only two possible declarations of a method: a predefined delegate and an instance method. In addition to that, I decided to check other ways of method declaration. So, the final list is as follows:

- predefined delegate;
- lambda expression;
- lambda expression that calls instance method;
- lambda expression that calls static method;
- static anonymous method;
- static anonymous method that calls static method;
- anonymous method;
- anonymous method that calls instance method;
- anonymous method that calls static method;
- instance method;
- static method.

For benchmarking, I used the [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) library. The whole code of the benchmark class can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/alexeyfv/method-as-parameter).

## Results

The benchmark results are in the diagram below. As we can see, .NET 7 shows better results for everything related with static methods (except anonymous method + static method).

To understand why this happens, we have to go deeper and look at [IL code](https://sharplab.io/#gist:ecc53add5167ad4f90126c4dabbbace3). Basically, all these possible ways of method calling can be divided into two groups:

1. Which causes creation of a new object in the `for` loop on each iteration.
2. Which doesn’t cause creation of a new object in a `for` loop on each iteration

For example, let’s compare the code for calling a static method (4th row in the diagram):

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    CallAdd(StaticAdd, i, i);
}
```

In .NET 6, such code after compilation will look like:

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    // A new Func instance created on each iteration.
    CallAdd(new Func<int, int, int>(
      (object) null,
      __methodptr(StaticAdd)
    ), i, i);
}
```

In .NET 7 the situation is different:

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
    CallAdd(
        // A new Func instance created only once
        BenchmarkableClass.<>O.<1>__StaticAdd ?? (
            BenchmarkableClass.<>O.<1>__StaticAdd = new Func<int, int, int>(
                (object) null,
                __methodptr(StaticAdd)
                )), i, i
      );
}
```

The compiler created a new hidden static class `<>O` with public field `<1>__StaticAdd` of type `Func<int, int, int>` and this field will be initialized only once at the first iteration. The same situation and for other cases with static method.

Suboptimal .NET 6 code that creates new objects on each iteration [causes unnecessary heap allocations](https://gitlab.com/alexeyfv/method-as-parameter/-/blob/main/BenchmarkDotNet.Artifacts/BenchmarkableClass-20231018-082910.log#L2075). Therefore, it also causes garbage collection, which also affects performance.

## Conclusion

Answering to the question in the title of this article: yes, the performance issues are still real, but the .NET platform becomes better.

If you’re using .NET 6 for development, it’s better to predefine a delegate instance before `for` loop or use lambda expression with static method.

For .NET 7 there are more options. You still can use predefined delegate or lambda expressions with static methods. But you can also pass a static method directly or pass an anonymous static method.
