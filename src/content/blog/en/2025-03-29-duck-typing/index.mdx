Experienced C# developers know the answer to the question: "What is needed to iterate over objects using `foreach`?"

You don’t have to inherit from the `IEnumerable` interface. It is enough for a class to have a public `GetEnumerator` method that returns an object implementing `IEnumerator`.

```csharp
// This code compiles
var obj = new MyType();
foreach (var item in obj);

class MyType {
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() {
        throw new Exception();
    }
}
```

This behavior is sometimes called duck typing — the compiler doesn’t care if a class implements `IEnumerable` or not. The only requirement is that it has a method returning an enumerator.

A similar behavior occurs when working with `async-await`. To "await" a type, it only needs a `GetAwaiter()` method that returns a `TaskAwaiter` or `ValueTaskAwaiter` type. This method doesn’t even have to be inside the awaited type itself.

```csharp
// This code also compiles
var obj = new MyType();
await obj;

class MyType {
}

static class MyTypeExtensions {
    public static TaskAwaiter GetAwaiter(this MyType @object) {
        throw new Exception();
    }
}
```

Recently, I found another example of something similar to duck typing. Since C# 12, there is a simplified way to initialize collections:

```csharp
int[] array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
List<int> list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

This concise syntax does not work with all collections. For example, the following code will not compile:

```csharp
Queue<int> queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Stack<int> stack = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

The compiler expects the collection type to have an `Add` method, but `Queue` uses `Enqueue` instead, and `Stack` uses `Push`. Since we cannot modify these types, we can use an extension method to help the compiler find `Add`.

```csharp
public static class CollectionExtensions {
    
    public static void Add<T>(this Queue<T> collection, T item) =>
        collection.Enqueue(item);

    public static void Add<T>(this Stack<T> collection, T item) => 
        collection.Push(item);
}
```

This syntax also works with custom collections, as long as they have an `Add` method—whether inside the type itself or as an extension method.

```csharp
MyType collection = [1, 2, 3];

class MyType : IEnumerable {
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() {
        throw new Exception();
    }
}

static class MyTypeExtensions {
    public static void Add(this MyType o, int value) { }
}
```
