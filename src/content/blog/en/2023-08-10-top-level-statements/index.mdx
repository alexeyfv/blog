Lately, I've been writing a lot of services that use [top-level statements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/top-level-statements). The code with this kind of syntax sugar simplifies the `Main` method and improves readability. However, on the other hand, it makes it more difficult to create integration tests for the services. There isn't simply way to call the `Main` method and pass the necessary arguments.

Since Microsoft introduced top-level statements in C# 9, you no longer need to write a weird Java-like `public static void Main(string[] args)` method. So the code

``` cs
using System;

namespace Application
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"args: {string.Join(",", args)}");
        }
    }
}
```

can be written just in one line:

``` cs
System.Console.WriteLine($"args: {string.Join(",", args)}");
```

But what if we want to call this code and pass some arguments? By default, the C# compiler will convert the code above to the [following code](https://sharplab.io/#v2:D4AQTAjAsAULIQJwAoAkAiAhgJwOYGcAuAAgG8EAGAOgCkB7ASwDtl0Aad4nAgSgF90PANywgA==):

``` cs
internal class Program
{
    private static void <Main>$(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(string.Concat("args: ", string.Join(",", args)));
    }
}
```

The class is internal, and the method is private. You cannot call the `<Main>` method directly, especially from another assembly. How can you overcome this?

First of all, you should declare the `Program` class as `public partial`. This makes the `Program` class visible in external code. If you can’t change the code, you can load the type from the assembly using [Assembly.GetType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.gettype).

``` cs
System.Console.WriteLine($"args: {string.Join(",", args)}");

public partial class Program { }
```

Now that the `Program` class has [become visible](https://sharplab.io/#v2:D4AQTAjAsAULIQJwAoAkAiAhgJwOYGcAuAAgG8EAGAOgCkB7ASwDtl0Aad4nAgSgF90PANyx4AZmIAHHABcGmADbFwyiAHYyxPrCA===) from other assemblies, the `<Main>` method is still private. Using reflection, we can retrieve the `<Main>` method from the `DeclaredMethods` collection and call it using `Invoke`:

``` cs
var typeInfo = typeof(Program) as TypeInfo ?? throw new InvalidOperationException();
var main = typeInfo.DeclaredMethods.First(m => m.Name == "<Main>");
var args = new[] { "arg1", "arg2" };
main.Invoke(null, new object[] { args });
```

That’s it. Reflection provides a powerful mechanism which helps us with writing tests for programs that use top-level statements.
